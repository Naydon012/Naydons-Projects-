<h4> By becoming one of our crew members you'll be able to clean our city and make it better for everyone around. We mostly encourage students to join our program to receive community service hours. What this group does every 3 days we pick new neighborhoods to come visit and pick up trash, and plant new flowers. With this organization you'll be able to pick which days you can come join us and how long your shift will be. If you are interested in joining this program please feel free to email us at any time so we can tell you where we are planning to go next and to get your working schedule. Our company email is [greencommunity@gmail.com] or feel free to call between our office hours 9-5 weekdays at (201)-967-8098.
