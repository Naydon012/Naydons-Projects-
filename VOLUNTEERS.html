  <h4>What you can do to help the community?</h4>
<div class="container">

<p>We host many events around the world to bring our community together while helping the environment. Not only do we host these events but we make sure to teach everyone attending how their household can help us all for example, to lessen their carbon footprint. Times Square alone uses 161 megawatts of electricity every year which isn't helping the environment. In New York City the population continues to increase which means the trash rate will too and if it's not properly taken care of the environment will face more of a decline faster. You will be given the option of how many sessions you will like to attend each one is 4 hours long. You can pick from a single session which you'll be taught only some improvements that can be made based on what most of the public does that isn't the best for the environment. A monthly session is four sessions for a month in which you'll be taught about how to fix some mistakes your household is making and how to substitute these mistakes for more environmentally safe options. Lastly a yearly subscription which is 5 meetings a month for a year and you'll be taught everything that you can change for a little to waste life. Also you'll be given the option to let our company help your neighborhood become more eco-friendly. </p>
